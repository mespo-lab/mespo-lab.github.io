## Research Interests
His research topics include but not limited to the following aspects:
- **Planning and operation of integrated-energy systems:** such as (islanded/grid-connected) microgrids, ships, seaports, smart buildings, etc., with integrated power, thermal, and gas networks.
- **Tackling diverse uncertainties:** such as those from renewable energies, outdoor temperature, gas prices, and ship swinging with the multi-stage (distributional) robust/stochastic optimization methods in multi-energy systems.
- **Resilience enhancement of integrated-energy systems with demand response scheme and heterogeneous transportable energy storage.** 
- **Advanced algorithms development and application in multi-energy operations** such as approximate dynamic programming, deep reinforcement learning, machine learning, etc.
