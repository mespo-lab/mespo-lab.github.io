<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<!-- I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). My research involves magnetoelectric ("ME") materials for energy-efficient information technology and "ME" materials for data security in information technology using Multiferroics/Magneto-ionics/Surface charging, with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation and implantation. -->
Dr. Li received the B.E. degree in information engineering and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Ji'nan, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2020. During 2019-2021, he was a Research Fellow with the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA under IEEE Fellow, [Prof. Wu Lei](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/lwu11). From 2021-2023, he was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University and Singapore ETH Center under IEEE Fellow, Prof. Wang Peng and [Prof. Xu Yan](https://eexuyan.github.io/soda/index.html). From April. 2023, Dr.Li joined Aalto University as an Assistant Professor.
## Research Interest:
His research topics include but not limited to the following aspects:
- **Planning and operation of integrated-energy systems:** such as (islanded/grid-connected) microgrids, ships, seaports, smart buildings, etc., with integrated power, thermal, and gas networks.
- **Tackling diverse uncertainties:** such as those from renewable energies, outdoor temperature, gas prices, and ship swinging with the multi-stage (distributional) robust/stochastic optimization methods in multi-energy systems.
- **Resilience enhancement of integrated-energy systems with demand response scheme and heterogeneous transportable energy storage.** 
- **Advanced algorithms development and application in multi-energy operations** such as approximate dynamic programming, deep reinforcement learning, machine learning, etc.
