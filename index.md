&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Li received a Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2020. During 2019-2021, he was a Research Fellow with the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA under IEEE Fellow, [Prof. Wu Lei](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/lwu11). From 2021-2023, he was a Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University and Singapore ETH Center under IEEE Fellow, Prof. Wang Peng and [Prof. Xu Yan](https://eexuyan.github.io/soda/index.html). From April. 2023, Dr. Li joined [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) as an Assistant Professor. 
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till Nov 2023, he has published 36 journal papers, 9 conference papers, 2 books, and 2 patents. Among them, there are 13 first-authored journal papers of which 10 are top-tier journals and 4 first-authored conference papers. He got Google Scholar citations 1911 times (h index 22, i10 index: 32) and in total 6 highly cited research papers (4 of which are first-authored journal papers). One paper is regarded as pioneering research on the IEEE Spotlight website. In 2023, he was selected into the World's Top 2% of Scientists in the subfield of “Energy”.

## Research Interests
His research topics include but not limited to the following aspects:
- **Planning and operation of integrated-energy systems:** such as (islanded/grid-connected) microgrids, ships, seaports, smart buildings, etc., with integrated power, thermal, and gas networks.
- **Tackling diverse uncertainties:** such as those from renewable energies, outdoor temperature, gas prices, and ship swinging with the multi-stage (distributional) robust/stochastic optimization methods in multi-energy systems.
- **Resilience enhancement of integrated-energy systems with demand response scheme and heterogeneous transportable energy storage.** 
- **Advanced algorithms development and application in multi-energy operations** such as approximate dynamic programming, deep reinforcement learning, machine learning, etc.
